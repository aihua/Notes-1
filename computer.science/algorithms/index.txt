Solving recurrences
    1. Guess    the form of the solution
    2. Verify   by induction
    3. Solve    for constants.

Recursion Tree
    Draw Recursion tree

The divide-and-conquer design paradigm
    1. Divide the problem into subproblems
    2. Conquer the subproblems by solving them recursively
    3. Combine subproblem solutions

Decision tree model
Quantification

Progam an algorithm
    1. write frame
    2. check boundary
        if not sure, simplify:
            let all input variable be zero
            let all input variable be maximium value
    3. test
