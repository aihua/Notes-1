tasks
    Emits a list of all tasks available in the current build file. Note that plug-ins may
    introduce tasks of their own, so this list may be longer than the tasks you have
    defined.

--help or -h
    Prints out the help messages describing all command-line options.

-Dproperty=value
    Defines a system property. This is a useful mechanism for passing parameters into
    a build from the command line. Example: -Dcustom.config=my-config.properties.

--info or -i
    Sets the Gradle log level to INFO, which causes a few more informative messages
    to be emitted over the default setting.

--debug or -d
    Turns out debug logging for the build, including stack traces. This generates a lot
    of output, but can be quite useful for troubleshooting build problems.

--dry-run or -m
    Evaluates and runs the build file, but does not execute any task actions.

--quiet or -q
    Suppresses most output, showing error messages only.

--gui
    Launches the Gradle GUI.

--stacktrace or -s
    Emits an abbreviated stack trace when an exception is thrown by the build.
    Normally, stack trace logging is suppressed, so this is a helpful switch when
    debugging a broken build. The stack trace is abbreviated by removing frames
    related to purely internal Groovy method calls.
    10 | Chapter 1: Hello, Gradle!

--full-stacktrace or -S
    Emits a longer version of the --stacktrace output, including all internal Groovy
    method calls. These are usually not of interest to the build developer.

properties
    Emits all the properties of the buildâ€™s Project object. The Project object is an object
    representing the structure and state of the current build.
