Abstract Methods and Classes

    An abstract class is a class that is declared abstractâ€”it may or may not include abstract methods. 
    Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, but they can be subclassed.

    An abstract method is a method that is declared without an implementation

If a class includes abstract methods, the class itself must be declared abstract
