MIME headers
    MIME-Version
        MIME-Version: 1.0

    Content-ID
        primarily of use in multi-part messages
        permanently globally unique identifier for a message part

        Content-ID: <5.31.32252.1057009685@server01.example.net>

    Content-Type
        Content-Type: text/plain

    Content-Disposition
        specify the presentation style

        inline content-disposition
            it should be automatically displayed when the message is displayed

        attachment content-disposition
            it is not displayed automatically and requires some form of action from the user to open it

        RFC 2183
         Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=genome.jpeg;
                  modification-date="Wed, 12 February 1997 16:29:51 -0500";

    Content-Transfer-Encoding

Multipart messages
    contains a boundary in the "Content-Type: " header
    the boundary is placed between the parts, 
        and at the beginning and end of the body of the message
    this boundary must not occur in any of the parts

    for example:
        MIME-Version: 1.0
        Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="frontier"

        This is a message with multiple parts in MIME format.
        --frontier
        Content-Type: text/plain

        This is the body of the message.
        --frontier
        Content-Type: application/octet-stream
        Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64

        PGh0bWw+CiAgPGhlYWQ+CiAgPC9oZWFkPgogIDxib2R5PgogICAgPHA+VGhpcyBpcyB0aGUg
        Ym9keSBvZiB0aGUgbWVzc2FnZS48L3A+CiAgPC9ib2R5Pgo8L2h0bWw+Cg==
        --frontier--

    Each part consists of its own content header (zero or more Content-header fields) and a body. 

    Before the first boundary is an area that is ignored by MIME-compliant clients. 
        This area is generally used to put a message to users of old non-MIME clients.

    The last boundary must have two hyphens at the end.

    Multipart subtypes
        specified in the "Content-Type" header of the overall message

        multipart/mixed,...

        4 subtypes: 
            mixed
                sending files with different "Content-Type" headers inline (or as attachments)
            digest 
                simple way to send multiple text messages
                The default content-type for each part is "message/rfc822".
            alternative 
            parallel

        should treat unrecognised subtypes as "multipart/mixed"
