Accept-Charset = "Accept-Charset" ":"
    1#( ( charset | "*" )[ ";" "q" "=" qvalue ] )

    Each charset MAY be given an associated quality value which represents the user's preference for that charset. 
    The default value is q=1. An example is
        Accept-Charset: iso-8859-5, unicode-1-1;q=0.8
            iso-8859-5: q=1 (default value)
            unicode-1-1: q=0.8

    The special value "*" matches every character set (including ISO-8859-1) 
    If no "*" is present in an Accept-Charset field, 
        then all character sets not explicitly mentioned get a quality value of 0, 
        except for ISO-8859-1 ,which gets a quality value of 1 if not explicitly mentioned. 

    If no Accept-Charset header is present, the default is that any character set is acceptable
