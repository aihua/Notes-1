Radio Data System
    a communications protocol standard 
    embedding small amounts of digital information in conventional FM radio broadcasts

Radio Broadcast Data System (RBDS) 
    the official name used for the U.S. version of RDS
    The two standards are only slightly different

RDS standardises
    several types of information transmitted
    including 
        time 
        station identification 
        programme information

Content and implementation
    The following information fields are normally contained in the RDS data:
    AF (alternative frequencies)
        allows a receiver to re-tune to a different frequency 
        providing the same station
        when the first signal becomes too weak
            (e.g., when moving out of range)
            utilized in car stereo systems

    CT (clock time)
        synchronize a clock in the receiver or the main clock in a car
        only be accurate to within 100 ms of UTC

    EON (enhanced other networks)
        Allows the receiver to monitor 
            other networks 
            or stations for traffic programmes

        automatically temporarily tune into that station

    PI (programme identification)
        the unique code that identifies the station
        Every station receives a specific code with a country prefix
        In the US, PI is determined by applying a formula to the station's call sign

    PS (programme service)
        simply an eight-character static display
        represents the call letters or station identity name
        if the station is stored in the receiver's presets,  will cache this information 
            with the frequency and other details associated with that preset

    PTY (programme type)
        up to 31 pre-defined programme types
            (e.g., in Europe: PTY1 News, PTY6 Drama, PTY11 Rock music) 

        allows users to find similar programming by genre

    REG (regional)
        used in countries where national broadcasters run "region-specific" programming 
        allows the user to "lock-down" the set to their current region
        let the radio tune into other region-specific programming as they move into the other region

    RT (radio text)
        allows a radio station to transmit a 64-character free-form textual information
        can be either 
            static e.g. station slogans or 
            in sync with the programming 
                such as the title and artist of the currently playing song

    TA, TP (traffic announcement, traffic programme)
        The receiver can often be set to pay special attention to this flag 
            for example, stop the tape/pause the CD or retune to receive a traffic bulletin

        TP flag 
            allow the user to find only those stations that regularly broadcast traffic bulletins

        TA flag
            stop the tape or raise the volume during a traffic bulletin


    TMC (Traffic Message Channel)
        Digitally encoded traffic information
        Not all RDS equipment supports this
            Often available for Automotive navigation systems
            In many countries only encrypted data is broadcast
                and so a subscription and appropriate decoder is required to use

RDS support
    As far as implementation is concerned, most car stereos will support at least AF, EON, REG, PS and TA/TP.
        * More expensive car stereos will offer TMC, RT and / or PTY, perhaps with "NEWS" override.
        * Home systems, especially hi-fi receivers, will mainly support functions like PS, RT and PTY.

Example RDS usage
    showing the PS name (programme service) field. // 比如"北京交通台"
    showing the name and artist of the song being broadcast
        - Duran Duran's Save a Prayer - the bottom line scrolls to reveal the rest of the text.
        Scrolling Program Service messages are illegal in the U.K

RDS chipsets
    ST Microelectronics
    Silicon Labs
        part supports PS, RT, PTY, TMC, and all other RDS types 
    NXP Semiconductors
