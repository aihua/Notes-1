Introduction

Skia is organized the Canvas object. 
    It is the host for the "draw" calls: drawRect, drawPath, drawText, etc. 

    Each of these has two components: 
        1. the primitive being drawing (SkRect, SkPath, SkBitmap, etc.) 
        绘制的基本内容, 点，矩形，

        2. color/style attributes (SkPaint).
            The paint holds much of the state describing how the rectangle (in this case) is drawn: 
                what color it is, 
                if it is filled or stroked, 
                how it should blend with what was previously drawn.

            paint（画笔）决定绘制的样式

    canvas.drawRect(rect, paint); 

        drawPoint, drawPoints, 
        drawLine, drawPath, drawArc, drawSprite
        drawRect, drawRoundRect, drawCircle, drawOval, drawShape
        drawColor, drawBitmap
        drawText 

        What is sprite?

    The canvas hold relatively little state:
        It points to the actual pixels being draw (hosted by a Bitmap), 
            canvas保存了绘制的像素, 在Bitmap中
        and it maintains a stack of matrices and clips. 
        
        Thus in the above call, the canvas' current matrix may transform the coordinates of the rectangle 
            (translation, rotation, skewing, perspective), 

        and the canvas' current clip may restrict where on the canvas the rectangle be draw, 

            canvas决定了绘制的位置，角度，缩放等等

        but all other stylistic attributes of the drawing are controlled by the paint. 

总结
    skia绘图的三要素：
        canvas: 在那儿画
            canvas决定了绘制的位置，角度，缩放等等
            绘制的所有pixel都(通过Bitmap)保存在canvas中

        画笔: 怎么画
            颜色，样式, 和原来内容的混合

        绘制内容: 画什么
            点，线，曲线，矩形，圆形，椭圆，颜色，位图，文字
