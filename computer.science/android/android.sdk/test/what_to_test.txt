从单元测试的角度考虑，应该测试什么

    Change in orientation
        landscape
        portrait
            
        当Android发现屏幕的横竖方向变化后
            关闭前台的Activity, 并重新启动该activity

        考虑的测试case:
            1. UI绘制是否正确
                Is the screen re-drawn correctly? 
                Any custom UI code you have should handle changes in the orientation.

            2. 应用程序的状态是否被保存了
            Does the application maintain its state? 
                The Activity should not lose anything that the user has already entered into the UI. 
                The application should not "forget" its place in the current transaction.

    Change in configuration
        such as 
            a change in the availability of a keyboard 
            a change in system language.

        当Android发现configuration变化后
            关闭前台的Activity, 并重新启动该activity

        考虑的测试case:
            1. UI绘制是否正确
            2. 应用程序的状态是否被保存了

    Battery life
        need to test the methods that manage battery usage

    Dependence on external resources
        测试如果network access, SMS, Bluetooth, or GPS等等资源都不在的时候
        程序是如何表现的

        需要提示网络连接不存在
