Color space
    RGB color space

    YUV
        Y' stands for the luma component (the brightness) 
            luminance is denoted by Y 
                "luminance" meaning perceptual (color science) brightness

            luma by Y' – the prime symbols (') denote gamma compression
                gamma correction: the name of a nonlinear operation used to code and decode luminance
                    simplest case:
                               y
                    Vout = A Vin
                        A: constant, in common case A = 1

                 "luma" is electronic (voltage of display) brightness.

        U and V are the chrominance (color) components


        why YUV
            allowing reduced bandwidth for chrominance components

            Y' is transmitted seperately with UV, which is used by black-and-white system

        alias
            Y'UV, YUV, YCbCr, YPbPr,

            YCbCr
            YPbPr
                is a scaled version of YUV.  in analog component video
                It is most commonly seen in its digital form, YCbCr, 
                used widely in video and image compression schemes such as MPEG and JPEG.

            YUV and Y'UV 
                for specific analog encoding of color information in television systems

        structure:
            one luma (Y') and two chrominance (UV) components.

    HSV color space
        Hue, Saturation, (brightness)Value

        HSV is a transformation of an RGB colorspace
        often used by artists

    Luma
        luma represents the brightness in an image 
        the "black-and-white" or achromatic portion of the image

        Y for short

    Chrominance(chroma)
        represent the color information

        as approximate representations of the relative amounts of blue and red in the color.
        represented as two color-difference components: 
            U = B′ − Y′ (blue − luma)
            V = R′ − Y′ (red − luma)

     It is similar to the YUV
        except that the YIQ color space is rotated 33° with respect to the YUV color space and the color axes are swapped
