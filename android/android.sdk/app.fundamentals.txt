什么是context
    用于获取应用程序全局信息的接口
        如获取程序的资源，类，启动activity, 广播和接收intent等等

share data with other applications 
    two applications share the same Linux user ID
        be able to access each other's files
        can arrange to run in the same Linux process 
        can share the same VM

    can request permission to access device data 

Application Components
    four types of application components
        Activities
            represents a single screen with a user interface

        Services
            runs in the background to perform long-running operations 
                or to perform work for remote processes
            does not provide a user interface
            examples:
                play music in the background 
                fetch data over the network without blocking user interaction

        Content providers
            manages a shared set of application data
            other applications can query or even modify the data

        Broadcast receivers
            responds to system-wide broadcast announcements
            each broadcast is delivered as an Intent object

    principle
        any application can start another application's component 

        when the system starts a component
            it starts the process for that application(if it's not already running)
            initiate the classes needed for that component

        Android applications don't have a single entry point (there's no main() function, for example)

    activating components
        an intent activates
            activities
               passing an Intent to startActivity() 
                or startActivityForResult() 
            services
                passing an Intent to startService(). 
                    Or passing an Intent to bindService()
            broadcast reciever
                passing an Intent to methods like 
                    sendBroadcast(), 
                    sendOrderedBroadcast(), 
                    sendStickyBroadcast().

            an inten 
                the action to perform 
                specify the URI of the data to act on
                may returns the result in another Intent

        content provider
           activated when targeted by a request from a ContentResolver 
           perform a query to a content provider by calling query() on a ContentResolver

The Manifest File
    An application must declare all its components in the manifest file

    In addition to declaring the application's components
        Identify any user permissions the application requires
        Declare the minimum API Level required by the application
        Declare hardware and software features used or required by the application
        API libraries the application needs to be linked against

    Declaring components
        activities:
            <application android:icon="@drawable/app_icon.png" ... >
                <activity android:name="com.example.project.ExampleActivity"
                    android:label="@string/example_label" ... >
                </activity>
                ...
            </application>

        Activities, services, and content providers
            must declare in the manifest, other not visible to the system

    Declaring component capabilities
        Declare intent filters to catch intents

    Declaring application requirements
        Screen size and density
            screen size 
                the physical dimensions of the screen
                small, normal, large, and extra large
            screen density
                the physical density of the pixels on the screen, or dpi—dots per inch
                low density, medium density, high density, and extra high density

            By default, your application is compatible with all screen sizes and densities

        <uses-configuration> 
            used for input configurations

        <uses-feature>
            used for requiring hareware and software features, like a camera, a light sensor, a certain version of OpenGL 

        <uses-sdk>
            used for the minimum API level

Application Resources
    sdk build tools define a unique resource id for for each resource
        R.drawable.logo for res/drawable/logo.png 

    seperate resources from source code
