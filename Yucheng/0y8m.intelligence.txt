    reading to your baby often

            while poiting to the object

        baby tone, higher pitch, exaggerated vowels (Helloooo, baaaa-byyyyy)


        Let the babbling begin for your baby

    hearing a foreign language
    singing to your baby yourself

    make face-to-face interaction
        read facial expression

    get down on the floor at her level and have fun with her
    user you imagination

    less TV

bond with your baby

    skin-to-skin contact/face time/baby message/talking/wearing  helps build sense of safety
