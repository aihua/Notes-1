in the range 87.5 to 108.0 MHZ

数据信号由VHF/FM发射器通过一个载波被添加到stereo/mono多路复用信号中

the subcarrier frequency will be locked to the third harmonic of the 19-kHz pilot-tone.


During monophonic broadcasts the frequency of the subcarrier will be 
    57 kHz ± 6 Hz.

Subcarrier phase
    During stereo broadcasts the subcarrier will be locked 
        either in phase or 
        in quadrature to the third harmonic of the 19 kHz pilot-tone. 

    The tolerance on this phase angle is ± 10,


In the case when ARI and radio-data signals are transmitted simultaneously, 
    the phase angle between the two subcarriers shall be 90 ± 10.
