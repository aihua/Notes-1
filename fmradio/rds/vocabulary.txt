multiplex spectrum

third harmonic of the 19-kHz pilot-tone

The deviation range of the FM carrier due to the unmodulated subcarrier is from ± 1.0 kHz to ± 7.5 kHz.

The subcarrier is amplitude-modulated by the shaped and biphase coded data signal (see 1.7).

from binary "0" to binary "1" or vice-versa)
