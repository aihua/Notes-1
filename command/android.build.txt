Flash a Device

    要是没有adb和fastboot, build:
        make fastboot adb


    Place the device in fastboot mode either manually by 
        1. holding the appropriate key combination at boot, 
            maguro(Galaxy Nexus): Press and hold both Volume Up and Volume Down, then press and hold Power

        2. or from the shell with
            $ adb reboot bootloader
                reboot from Android directly into the bootloader with no key combinations

                $ adb reboot recovery # 进入recovery模式

    Unlocking the bootloader
        It's only possible to flash a custom system if the bootloader allows it.
        Galaxy Nexus the bootloader is locked by default
        With the device in fastboot mode, the bootloader is unlocked with

        $ fastboot oem unlock
        $ fastboot oem lock    # lock bootloader


    Once the device is in fastboot mode, run
        $ fastboot flashall -w
        # -w option wipes the /data partition on the device


Obtaining proprietary binaries
    不是开源的代码
    这些binary下载下来后，需要在root src目录下解压
        自解压后会放到vendor目录

    变更了设备后，需要调用下面语句清空上一次build产生的文件
        $ make clobber
